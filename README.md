# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Reflection:

OMG this was tough....

a few CSS tricks were stolen from online... sorry the animations are not my forte!

many things i would do differently:

i didnt get round to sorting media queries.
I need to do more styling to make it look better
i want sounds
the local storage issue i had i couldnt solve. instead i created a reset button which was an alternative method.
